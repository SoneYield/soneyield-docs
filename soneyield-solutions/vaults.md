# Vaults

## How Do Vaults Work on Soneium?

Vaults are integral to SoneYield. When users deposit tokens into a vault, their funds are automatically compounded as the strategies farm and reinvest rewards. Vault shares grow over time, and users can withdraw their assets at any point. Our vaults operate with Soneiumâ€™s fast transaction speeds and low gas fees, ensuring efficient yield farming.



## Vault Fee Structure

Each vault on Soneium comes with a performance fee that helps sustain the platform. This fee is deducted from the rewards generated and goes toward maintaining the infrastructure, paying contributors, and funding new development. The low transaction costs on Soneium make this structure highly competitive.
